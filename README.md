# Deep-Learning-Lab-AAU
## Deep Learning Lab Exercises Repository
Welcome to my Deep Learning Lab Exercises repository! Here, you'll find a collection of exercises, projects, and experiments I've completed during my deep learning course as part of my undergraduate studies in Software Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

## What You'll Find Here
This repository is a hub for the practical work I've undertaken during my deep learning lab class. You can expect to find:
* Exercises: Step-by-step implementations of fundamental deep learning concepts.
* Projects: Real-world applications of deep learning techniques, ranging from image recognition to natural language processing.
* Experiments: Innovative experiments exploring the capabilities and limitations of deep learning models.
* Documentation: Detailed explanations, code samples, and results analysis for each exercise or project.

## How to Use This Repository
Feel free to explore the exercises, projects, and experiments. Each folder contains the problem statement, the approach taken, and the outcomes. You'll also find the corresponding Python code and any necessary datasets in their respective folders.
